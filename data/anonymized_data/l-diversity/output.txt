The data verifies l-diversity with l=1

Finished for l=1

Finished for l=2

l-diversity cannot be achieved for l=3

Finished for l=3

l-diversity cannot be achieved for l=4

Finished for l=4

l-diversity cannot be achieved for l=5

Finished for l=5

l-diversity cannot be achieved for l=6

Finished for l=6

This makes sense, because there are only two possible values for the sensitive value
